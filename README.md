# 💧 Water Management in Chennai (Using Time Series Analysis)

This project aims to analyze and forecast water consumption patterns in Chennai using time series analysis techniques. By leveraging historical data, it provides insights and predictions to support sustainable water management strategies.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict future water demand in Chennai to improve planning and resource allocation.
- **Methodology**: Time series forecasting using Python-based libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and ARIMA models.
- **Outcome**: Visualization of trends and forecasting water demand to guide efficient water distribution and conservation efforts.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data preprocessing and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Statsmodels** – Time series modeling (ARIMA)

## 📁 Files Included

- `Water_Mangement_Chennai(Using_Time_Series).ipynb` – The main Jupyter notebook with code, analysis, and visualizations.
- *(Optional: Add data files or links to datasets if applicable)*

## 📈 Key Features
